            <h2> Color Schema</h2>

            <p> The color scheme for this website draws directly from the Haitian flag, utilizing blue, red, and white to evoke a sense of national pride and cultural identity. 
                Blue, symbolizing Haiti’s beauty and resilience, will be used as the primary background color for headers and footers, providing a cohesive and calming base that reflects the nation’s rich landscapes and serene coastal views.
                 Red represents strength and vibrancy; it will be applied to buttons, accent elements, and call-to-action areas, drawing attention and inviting user engagement throughout the site. 
                 Finally, white will be used as a grounding element, ensuring readability and balance by being the main color for text on darker backgrounds and as a complementary accent around images and sections, creating a clean and inviting interface. 
                This harmonious blend of colors not only pays homage to Haiti’s heritage but also offers a visually compelling and culturally resonant experience for site visitors.</p>

            <h2> Typography</h2>

            <p> In the typography section of the planning document, we have selected two fonts to create a balanced and visually appealing design: <span class="bold-text">Roboto</span> and <span class="bold-text">Cinzel</span>. 
                <span class="bold-text">Roboto</span> will be used for body text, providing a modern and clean look that enhances readability across various devices. 
                Its versatility makes it suitable for paragraphs, ensuring that users can easily engage with the content.
                 For headings, <span class="bold-text">Cinzel</span> will be employed, lending a classic and elegant touch that draws attention and adds a sense of sophistication to the design.
                  This combination allows for a clear hierarchy in the text, with Cinzel’s bold presence complementing the simplicity of Roboto. 
                Additional fonts may be utilized for specific sections, such as quotes or highlights, to enhance the overall aesthetic and maintain visual interest throughout the website.</p>
